Files in this directory are automatically generated from your Rails bundles.
They are copied from the directories of each bundle into this directory
each time Rails starts (server, console). Any edits you make will NOT
persist across the next server restart; instead you should edit the files within
the bundle directory itself (e.g. vendor/plugins/bundle_resource/bundles/*).
