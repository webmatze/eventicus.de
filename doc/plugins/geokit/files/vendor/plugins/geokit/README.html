## FEATURE SUMMARY
</p>
<p>
This plugin provides key functionality for location-oriented Rails
applications:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance calculations, for both flat and spherical environments. For
example, given the location of two points on the earth, you can calculate
the miles/KM between them.

</li>
<li>ActiveRecord distance-based finders. For example, you can find all the
points in your database within a 50-mile radius.

</li>
<li>Geocoding from multiple providers. It currently supports Google, Yahoo,
Geocoder.us, and Geocoder.ca geocoders, and it provides a uniform response
structure from all of them. It also provides a fail-over mechanism, in case
your input fails to geocode in one service.

</li>
<li>IP-based location lookup utilizing hostip.info. Provide an IP address, and
get city name and latitude/longitude in return

</li>
<li>A before_filter helper to geocoder the user&#8216;s location based on IP
address, and retain the location in a cookie.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
The goal of this plugin is to provide the common functionality for
location-oriented applications (geocoding, location lookup, distance
calculation) in an easy-to-use package.
</p>
<p>
## A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY
</p>
<p>
Throughout the code and API of this, latitude and longitude are referred to
as lat and lng. We&#8216;ve found over the long term the abbreviation saves
lots of typing time.
</p>
<p>
## DISTANCE CALCULATIONS AND QUERIES
</p>
<p>
If you want only distance calculation services, you need only mix in the
Mappable module like so:
</p>
<pre>
    class Location
        include GeoKit::Mappable
    end
</pre>
<p>
After doing so, you can do things like:
</p>
<pre>
    Location.distance_between(from, to)
</pre>
<p>
with optional parameters :units and :formula. Values for :units can be
:miles or :kms with :miles as the default. Values for :formula can be
:sphere or :flat with :sphere as the default. :sphere gives you Haversine
calculations, while :flat gives the Pythagoreum Theory. These defaults
persist through out the plug-in.
</p>
<p>
You can also do:
</p>
<pre>
    location.distance_to(other)
</pre>
<p>
The real power and utility of the plug-in is in its query support. This is
achieved through mixing into an ActiveRecord model object:
</p>
<pre>
    class Location &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
        acts_as_mappable
    end
</pre>
<p>
The plug-in uses the above-mentioned defaults, but can be modified to use
different units and a different formulae. This is done through the
:default_units and :default_formula keys which accept the same values as
mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
The plug-in creates a calculated column and potentially a calculated
condition. By default, these are known as &quot;distance&quot; but this can
be changed through the :distance_field_name key.
</p>
<p>
So, an alternative invocation would look as below:
</p>
<pre>
    class Location &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
       acts_as_mappable :default_units =&gt; :kms,
                        :default_formula =&gt; :flat,
                        :distance_field_name =&gt; :distance
    end
</pre>
<p>
You can also define alternative column names for latitude and longitude
using the :lat_column_name and :lng_column_name keys. The defaults are
&#8216;lat&#8217; and &#8216;lng&#8217; respectively.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter, a set of finder methods are made available. Below are the
different combinations:
</p>
<p>
Origin as a two-element array of latititude/longitude:
</p>
<pre>
                find(:all, :origin =&gt; [37.792,-122.393])
</pre>
<p>
Origin as a geocodeable string:
</p>
<pre>
                find(:all, :origin =&gt; '100 Spear st, San Francisco, CA')
</pre>
<p>
Origin as an object which responds to lat and lng methods, or latitude and
longitude methods, or whatever methods you have specified for
lng_column_name and lat_column_name:
</p>
<pre>
                find(:all, :origin=&gt;my_store) # my_store.lat and my_store.lng methods exist
</pre>
<p>
Often you will need to find within a certain distance. The prefered syntax
is:
</p>
<pre>
    find(:all, :origin =&gt; @somewhere, :within =&gt; 5)
</pre>
<p>
. . . however these syntaxes will also work:
</p>
<pre>
    find_within(5, :origin =&gt; @somewhere)
    find(:all, :origin =&gt; @somewhere, :conditions =&gt; &quot;distance &lt; 5&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
Note however that the third form should be avoided. With either of the
first two, <a href="../../../../classes/GeoKit.html">GeoKit</a>
automatically adds a bounding box to speed up the radial query in the
database. With the third form, it does not.
</p>
<p>
If you need to combine distance conditions with other conditions, you
should do so like this:
</p>
<pre>
    find(:all, :origin =&gt; @somewhere, :within =&gt; 5, :conditions=&gt;['state=?',state])
</pre>
<p>
If :origin is not provided in the finder call, the find method works as
normal. Further, the key is removed from the :options hash prior to
invoking the superclass behavior.
</p>
<p>
Other convenience methods work intuitively and are as follows:
</p>
<pre>
    find_within(distance, :origin =&gt; @somewhere)
    find_beyond(distance, :origin =&gt; @somewhere)
    find_closest(:origin =&gt; @somewhere)
    find_farthest(:origin =&gt; @somewhere)
</pre>
<p>
where the options respect the defaults, but can be overridden if desired.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, if all that is desired is the raw SQL for distance calculations,
you can use the following:
</p>
<pre>
    distance_sql(origin, units=default_units, formula=default_formula)
</pre>
<p>
Thereafter, you are free to use it in find_by_sql as you wish.
</p>
<p>
There are methods available to enable you to get the count based upon the
find condition that you have provided. These all work similarly to the
finders. So for instance:
</p>
<pre>
    count(:origin, :conditions =&gt; &quot;distance &lt; 5&quot;)
    count_within(distance, :origin =&gt; @somewhere)
    count_beyond(distance, :origin =&gt; @somewhere)
</pre>
<p>
## FINDING WITHIN A BOUNDING BOX
</p>
<p>
If you are displaying points on a map, you probably need to query for
whatever falls within the rectangular bounds of the map:
</p>
<pre>
    Store.find :all, :bounds=&gt;[sw_point,ne_point]
</pre>
<p>
The input to :bounds can be array with the two points or a Bounds object.
However you provide them, the order should always be the southwest corner,
northeast corner of the rectangle. Typically, you will be getting the
sw_point and ne_point from a map that is displayed on a web page.
</p>
<p>
If you need to calculate the bounding box from a point and radius, you can
do that:
</p>
<pre>
    bounds=Bounds.from_point_and_radius(home,5)
    Store.find :all, :bounds=&gt;bounds
</pre>
<p>
## USING INCLUDES
</p>
<p>
You can use includes along with your distance finders:
</p>
<pre>
    stores=Store.find :all, :origin=&gt;home, :include=&gt;[:reviews,:cities] :within=&gt;5, :order=&gt;'distance'
</pre>
<p>
<b>However</b>, ActiveRecord drops the calculated distance column when you
use include. So, if you need to use the distance column, you&#8216;ll have
to re-calculate it post-query in Ruby:
</p>
<pre>
    stores.sort_by_distance_from(home)
</pre>
<p>
In this case, you may want to just use the bounding box condition alone in
your SQL (there&#8216;s no use calculating the distance twice):
</p>
<pre>
    bounds=Bounds.from_point_and_radius(home,5)
    stores=Store.find :all, :include=&gt;[:reviews,:cities] :bounds=&gt;bounds
    stores.sort_by_distance_from(home)
</pre>
<p>
## IP GEOCODING
</p>
<p>
You can obtain the location for an IP at any time using the geocoder as in
the following example:
</p>
<pre>
    location = IpGeocoder.geocode('12.215.42.19')
</pre>
<p>
where Location is a GeoLoc instance containing the latitude, longitude,
city, state, and country code. Also, the success value is true.
</p>
<p>
If the IP cannot be geocoded, a GeoLoc instance is returned with a success
value of false.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that the IP address needs to be visible to the Rails
application. In other words, you need to ensure that the requesting IP
address is forwarded by any front-end servers that are out in front of the
Rails app. Otherwise, the IP will always be that of the front-end server.
</p>
<p>
## IP GEOCODING HELPER
</p>
<p>
A class method called geocode_ip_address has been mixed into the
ActionController::Base. This enables before_filter style lookup of the IP
address. Since it is a filter, it can accept any of the available filter
options.
</p>
<p>
Usage is as below:
</p>
<pre>
    class LocationAwareController &lt; ActionController::Base
      geocode_ip_address
    end
</pre>
<p>
A first-time lookup will result in the GeoLoc class being stored in the
session as :geo_location as well as in a cookie called :geo_session.
Subsequent lookups will use the session value if it exists or the cookie
value if it doesn&#8216;t exist. The last resort is to make a call to the
web service. Clients are free to manage the cookie as they wish.
</p>
<p>
The intent of this feature is to be able to provide a good guess as to a
new visitor&#8216;s location.
</p>
<p>
## INTEGRATED FIND AND GEOCODING
</p>
<p>
Geocoding has been integrated with the finders enabling you to pass a
physical address or an IP address. This would look the following:
</p>
<pre>
    Location.find_farthest(:origin =&gt; '217.15.10.9')
    Location.find_farthest(:origin =&gt; 'Irving, TX')
</pre>
<p>
where the IP or physical address would be geocoded to a location and then
the resulting latitude and longitude coordinates would be used in the find.
This is not expected to be common usage, but it can be done nevertheless.
</p>
<p>
## ADDRESS GEOCODING
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/GeoKit.html">GeoKit</a> can geocode addresses
using multiple geocodeing web services. Currently, <a
href="../../../../classes/GeoKit.html">GeoKit</a> supports Google, Yahoo,
and Geocoder.us geocoding services.
</p>
<p>
These geocoder services are made available through three classes:
GoogleGeocoder, YahooGeocoder, and UsGeocoder. Further, an additional
geocoder class called MultiGeocoder incorporates an ordered failover
sequence to increase the probability of successful geocoding.
</p>
<p>
All classes are called using the following signature:
</p>
<pre>
    include GeoKit::Geocoders
    location = XxxGeocoder.geocode(address)
</pre>
<p>
where you replace Xxx Geocoder with the appropriate class. A GeoLoc
instance is the result of the call. This class has a &quot;success&quot;
attribute which will be true if a successful geocoding occurred. If
successful, the lat and lng properties will be populated.
</p>
<p>
Geocoders are named with the naming convention NameGeocoder. This naming
convention enables Geocoder to auto-detect its sub-classes in order to
create methods called name_geocoder(address) so that all geocoders are
called through the base class. This is done purely for convenience; the
individual geocoder classes are expected to be used independently.
</p>
<p>
The MultiGeocoder class requires the configuration of a provider order
which dictates what order to use the various geocoders. Ordering is done
through the PROVIDER_ORDER constant found in environment.rb.
</p>
<p>
On installation, this plugin appends a template for your API keys to your
environment.rb.
</p>
<p>
Make sure your failover configuration matches the usage characteristics of
your application &#8212; for example, if you routinely get bogus input to
geocode, your code will be much slower if you have to failover among
multiple geocoders before determining that the input was in fact bogus.
</p>
<p>
The Geocoder.geocode method returns a GeoLoc object. Basic usage:
</p>
<pre>
    loc=Geocoder.geocode('100 Spear St, San Francisco, CA')
    if loc.success
      puts loc.lat
      puts loc.lng
      puts loc.full_address
    end
</pre>
<p>
## INTEGRATED FIND WITH ADDRESS GEOCODING
</p>
<p>
Just has you can pass an IP address directly into an ActiveRecord finder as
the origin, you can also pass a physical address as the origin:
</p>
<pre>
    Location.find_closest(:origin =&gt; '100 Spear st, San Francisco, CA')
</pre>
<p>
where the physical address would be geocoded to a location and then the
resulting latitude and longitude coordinates would be used in the find.
</p>
<p>
Note that if the address fails to geocode, the find method will raise an
ActiveRecord::GeocodeError you must be prepared to catch. Alternatively,
You can geocoder the address beforehand, and pass the resulting lat/lng
into the finder if successful.
</p>
<p>
## Auto Geocoding
</p>
<p>
If your geocoding needs are simple, you can tell your model to
automatically geocode itself on create:
</p>
<pre>
    class Store &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_mappable :auto_geocode=&gt;true
    end
</pre>
<p>
It takes two optional params:
</p>
<pre>
    class Store &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_mappable :auto_geocode=&gt;{:field=&gt;:address, :error_message=&gt;'Could not geocode address'}
    end
</pre>
<p>
. . . which is equivilent to:
</p>
<pre>
    class Store &lt;&lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_mappable
      before_validation_on_create :geocode_address

      private
      def geocode_address
        geo=GeoKit::Geocoders::MultiGeocoder.geocode (address)
        errors.add(:address, &quot;Could not Geocode address&quot;) if !geo.success
        self.lat, self.lng = geo.lat,geo.lng if geo.success
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
If you need any more complicated geocoding behavior for your model, you
should roll your own before_validate callback.
</p>
<p>
## Distances, headings, endpoints, and midpoints
</p>
<pre>
    distance=home.distance_from(work, :units=&gt;:miles)
    heading=home.heading_to(work) # result is in degrees, 0 is north
    endpoint=home.endpoint(90,2)  # two miles due east
    midpoing=home.midpoint_to(work)
</pre>
<p>
## Cool stuff you can do with bounds
</p>
<pre>
    bounds=Bounds.new(sw_point,ne_point)
    bounds.contains?(home)
    puts bounds.center
</pre>
<p>
HOW TO . . .
</p>
<h6>===========================================================================</h6>
<p>
## How to install the <a href="../../../../classes/GeoKit.html">GeoKit</a>
plugin
</p>
<pre>
    cd [APP_ROOT]
    ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/geokit/trunk
      or, to install as an external (your project must be version controlled):
    ruby script/plugin install -x svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/geokit/trunk
</pre>
<p>
## How to find all stores within a 10-mile radius of a given lat/lng
</p>
<ol>
<li>ensure your stores table has lat and lng columns with numeric or float
datatypes to store your latitude/longitude

</li>
<li>use acts_as_mappable on your store model:

<pre>
 class Store &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_mappable
    ...
 end
</pre>
</li>
<li>finders now have extra capabilities:

<pre>
 Store.find(:all, :origin =&gt;[32.951613,-96.958444], :within=&gt;10)
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
## How to geocode an address
</p>
<ol>
<li>configure your geocoder key(s) in environment.rb

</li>
<li>also in environment.rb, make sure that PROVIDER_ORDER reflects the
geocoder(s). If you only want to use one geocoder, there should be only one
symbol in the array. For example:

<pre>
 PROVIDER_ORDER=[:google]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Test it out in script/console

<pre>
 include GeoKit::Geocoders
 res = MultiGeocoder.geocode('100 Spear St, San Francisco, CA')
 puts res.lat
 puts res.lng
 puts res.full_address
 ... etc. The return type is GeoLoc, see the API for
 all the methods you can call on it.
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
## How to find all stores within 10 miles of a given address
</p>
<ol>
<li>as above, ensure your table has the lat/lng columns, and you&#8216;ve
applied acts_as_mappable to the Store model.

</li>
<li>configure and test out your geocoder, as above

</li>
<li>pass the address in under the :origin key

<pre>
             Store.find(:all, :origin=&gt;'100 Spear st, San Francisco, CA',
                        :within=&gt;10)
</pre>
</li>
<li>you can also use a zipcode, or anything else that&#8216;s geocodable:

<pre>
             Store.find(:all, :origin=&gt;'94117',
                        :conditions=&gt;'distance&lt;10')
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
## How to sort a query by distance from an origin
</p>
<p>
You now have access to a &#8216;distance&#8217; column, and you can use it
as you would any other column. For example:
</p>
<pre>
                Store.find(:all, :origin=&gt;'94117', :order=&gt;'distance')
</pre>
<p>
## How to elements of an array according to distance from a common point
</p>
<p>
Usually, you can do your sorting in the database as part of your find call.
If you need to sort things post-query, you can do so:
</p>
<pre>
    stores=Store.find :all
    stores.sort_by_distance_from(home)
    puts stores.first.distance
</pre>
<p>
Obviously, each of the items in the array must have a latitude/longitude so
they can be sorted by distance.
</p>
<p>
Database Compatability
</p>
<h6>===========================================================================</h6>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/GeoKit.html">GeoKit</a> does <b>not</b> work
with SQLite, as it lacks the necessary geometry functions. <a
href="../../../../classes/GeoKit.html">GeoKit</a> works with MySQL (tested
with version 5.0.41) or PostgreSQL (tested with version 8.2.6) <a
href="../../../../classes/GeoKit.html">GeoKit</a> is known to <b>not</b>
work with Postgres &lt;8.1 &#8212; it uses the least() funciton.
</p>
<p>
HIGH-LEVEL NOTES ON WHAT&#8216;S WHERE
</p>
<h6>===========================================================================</h6>
<p>
acts_as_mappable.rb, as you&#8216;d expect, contains the ActsAsMappable
module which gets mixed into your models to provide the location-based
finder goodness.
</p>
<p>
mappable.rb contains the Mappable module, which provides basic distance
calculation methods, i.e., calculating the distance between two points.
</p>
<p>
mappable.rb also contains LatLng, GeoLoc, and Bounds. LatLng is a simple
container for latitude and longitude, but it&#8216;s made more powerful by
mixing in the above-mentioned Mappable module &#8212; therefore, you can
calculate easily the distance between two LatLng ojbects with distance =
first.distance_to(other)
</p>
<p>
GeoLoc (also in mappable.rb) represents an address or location which has
been geocoded. You can get the city, zipcode, street address, etc. from a
GeoLoc object. GeoLoc extends LatLng, so you also get lat/lng AND the
Mappable modeule goodness for free.
</p>
<p>
geocoders.rb contains the geocoder classes.
</p>
<p>
ip_geocode_lookup.rb contains the before_filter helper method which enables
auto lookup of the requesting IP address.
</p>
<p>
## IMPORTANT NOTE: We have appended to your environment.rb file
</p>
<p>
Installation of this plugin has appended an API key template to your
environment.rb file. You <b>must</b> add your own keys for the various
geocoding services if you want to use geocoding. If you need to refer to
the original template again, see the api_keys_template file in the root of
the plugin.
