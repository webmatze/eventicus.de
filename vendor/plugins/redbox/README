Redbox
======

Redbox is a very simple lightbox library, which is a way of display a model popup window which may contain any html, while the rest
of the page is faded out behind it. There are already many such libraries around for this, but:

 - Often they do a little more than I wanted
 - Many of them require a large javascript library that isn't prototype/scriptaculous. While I don't really have an opinion on which library
   is better, prototype is generally the one that we're using for rails, so I wanted a lightbox that took advantage of that,
   rather than forcing me to include another library which might class.
 - Many of them where not compatible with rails' ajax system. I wanted to be able to do multi-page forms within a lightbox,
   using form_remote_tag, or any other means of reloading the lightbox div using ajax.

And of course, I wanted it all packaged as a nice rails plugin with handy helpers to use it. 


Credits
=======

Much of the design, and some of the javascript and css are shamelessly ripped from the Thickbox library, by Cody Lindley. 

This library should be considered to be a derivative work of Thickbox, and is also released under the MIT licence.

Usage
=====

Examine the public methods of redbox_helper.rb. They will all look familiar, much like the existing link helpers, except that they work with redboxes. You should not need to interact with the javascript directly.
